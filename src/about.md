My name is Enrico. I work as a software developer for strategic projects at the [SAP Innovation Center Potsdam](https://icn.sap.com/home.html). I'm also responsible for the e-commerce platform of [Fruity Flowers](https://fruity-flowers.de), a small business run by my wife Nadine.

I am passionate about web development, software architecture and entrepreneurship. My blog is mainly about these topics, with occasional musings about music, food or life in general.
